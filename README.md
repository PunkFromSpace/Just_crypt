Basically a symmetric encryption tool.

Generates an ENC file and a KEY file via Just_Encrypt and then you can decrypt those files via Just_Decrypt.

Makes basic encryption accessible to more people.

Remember not to send the KEY file via the same channels as the ENC file. Find two separate (and secure) methods to send both ENC and KEY files to the intended recipient.
